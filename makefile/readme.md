### REMEMBER
All make files should be either name as `Makefile` or `makefile`
The first target in the makefile is the default target

### Build system
* these are tools that are used to automate the building and linking to source files into the final executable
* these are also smart enought to only recompile src files that have changes
* such as make, ninja, etc.

### Makefile
* the make file system is explained in the examples int the [examples](./examples/) directory
* the case of recursive scan is not covered
* there is cases where there can be modules having individual make files and the whole project can have one make file to trigger all, that too is not covered
